## Minix 3

- ##### In Minix 3, how to manage software, i.e. install, remove, update, etc.?

```shell
pkgin update  # update list of available packages
pkgin install [package name]  # install package
pkgin upgrade  # upgrade main packages to newer versions
pkgin remove [package name]  # remove package
```

- ##### What is the purpose of the commands `ifconfig`, `adduser`, and `passwd`?

`ifconfig`: initialize a TCP/IP device setting the IP address and/or netmask and report the address and netmask set

`adduser`: add a user to the system

`passwd`: modify a user's password

## Working on a remote server

- ##### What is the default SSH port? 

The default SSH port is 22.

- ##### List and explain the role of each the file in the `$HOME/.ssh` directory. 

```shell
ls ~/.ssh
# output
config  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
```

`config`: config file of SSH

`id_rsa`: private key

`id_rsa.pub`: public key

`known_hosts`: the SSH server logged before

- ##### Briefly explain how key-only authentication works in SSH. 

First send the pair of key generated by SSH client to the server. The SSH server then add the key to the authorized hosts list. Next time when connecting to the server, the server will use public key cryptography to verify the authority.
